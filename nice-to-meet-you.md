Hi there. I'm Nick Payne and it's nice to meet you.
{: .lead }

If you've found your way here it's because I've met you recently and gave you this link. This page contains some private stuff I don't just share with anybody. So enjoy and please reach out for a chat over a cup of coffee or a beer.

If you're looking for a cinematographer, camera assistant, lighting assistant, or colourist then I'm keen to work with you.

There's some useful stuff below and feel free to browse the [rest of my website](/) to see examples of my work.
