In the age of social media, video content for musicians is becoming more important than ever. Once it was just about the music video, but now that video needs to be accompanied by a continual streem of reels.
{: .lead }

As a musician myself I am passionate about, and commited to music videos as an art form that accompanies --- and amplifies --- the art of the song itself. A great music video is not just about pretty images, but about bolstering the emotion of the music itself. A great music video hooks you into the song and gives you a deeper understanding and love for what you are hearing, through what you are seeing.

> At the same time, I realise the business side of music demands that a music video is accompanied by a release plan and a marketing strategy.

For this reason all our packages come not just with the "hero" content itself --- the music video, or live field performances --- but also come with images, reels, interview/behind-the-scenes videos, and a 12 week release and marketing plan.

This not only gives you your "hero" content, but enough ancillary content to keep your social media presences busy for three months.
