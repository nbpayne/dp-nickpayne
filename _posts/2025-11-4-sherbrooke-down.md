Over the last year I've had the pleasure of being attached to "Sherbrooke Down: Valley of Tears" a feature film is written and directed by James Stewart Keene.
{: .lead }

"Sherbrooke Down: Valley of Tears" tells the story of Evangeline Keene (Sariah Robers) who lives in the village of Sherbrooke in the Cataract Valley in 1902. She is married to Matthew (Paul Hughes) who makes a series of poor financial decisions leading to their family moving Sherbrooke from Bulli. In trying to create a new life in Sherbrooke, Evangeline earns the ire of Sarah (Erica Nelson) the wife of wealthy landowner Charles (Craig McLachlan). As the conflict escalates Evangeline and Sarah are eventually brought together through shared adversity. Charles is equally softened to the Keenes by his friend William Williamsburg (John Jarratt). This personal story occurs against the background of the government seizing the land in Sherbrooke to build the Cataract Dam in order to secure a water supply for Sydney during the great drought.

The visual reference for the film is the classic 1982 Australian film "The Man from Snowy River". Both of these films are period films set in the Australian bush flush with organic, muted browns and greens. As always locations, wardrobe and production design work hard to create this period look. In lighting interiors I am leaning heavily towards filling the space with daylight balanced light from outside. As this light come in through windows and plays with the earthy tones of the production design it's colour is warmed up and once can be mistaken for thinking the scenes are lit with tungsten. We shot with anamorphic lenses on a Super 35 sensor. Action plays out as much as possible in mid shots with the camera stable and moving when needed to match the blocking of actors. This has allowed for shots to play long with some scenes even able to be delivered in a single shot.

We've shot about 25 pages of this film and are currently seeking investors to support us completing the film. Reach out if you're interested.
