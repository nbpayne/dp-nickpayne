A field recording of Brodie Buttons and Dusty Rusty playing at the Crooked Tune Distillery.
{: .lead }

George Artin and I got a call one Saturday night from Aaron at Crooked Tune Distillery to come in and record two travelling folk musicians playing live in the distillery. Whatever we had in the car that night was what we used and I'm really happy with the result.

Audio was capture with an SE Electronics SE4400a. Mixed in Pro Tools. Shot on a Blackmagicn Design Cinema Camera 6K. Edited and colour graded in DaVinci Resolve.

I really love this style of video as it combines my previous creative life as a musician with my new life as a filmmaker. Definitely looking forward to doing more of these.
