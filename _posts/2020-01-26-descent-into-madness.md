“They are faceless and mine is all that's left. A million years of family trees die one person at a time... And time is the lonely sound of this heart ticking towards a twitching time-bomb”
{: .lead }

Written and performed by Craig Moffatt, "Descent Into Madness" details the loss of sanity of _The Madman_ as a monologue. Created one afternoon in January as an exercise in how quickly we could write and shoot something. _The Madman_ is light with a single, high-powered continuous LED light shaped by a beauty dish. A six stop difference between subject and background allows the light to fall off into inky darkness.

Also on set was director Paul Matereke, and Sean Burns recording sound.
