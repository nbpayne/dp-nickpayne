A man wakes up in an unfamiliar room to meet his captor --- a genie --- who has bought him here to pay for his sins. He has one wish left. What happened to the other two?

Ambitious, graduate director Daniel Watson came to me to edit and colour grade this fascinating, short, psychological thriller. Shot by Muhib Faris on a RED Gemini, this film features some fantastic, moody, low key scenes.

It was a great pleasure and challenge to colour grade this film in order to create a distinct, vintage look that matched the cinematographers vision. Part of the process also included incorporating VFX effects from a third party and bringing everything seamlessly together.

It's always a great experience to work directly with a director in a collaborative creative process. Sitting together in the edit room always trumps sending notes back and forth in my experience. I look forward to working with Daniel again.
