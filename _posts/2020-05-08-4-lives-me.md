"4 Lives / Me" is the first in a series of interviews with people experiencing differing impacts of the SARS-COV-2 virus. In this first film the I kick the series off by interviewing myself. As I explore the themes of busyness and being forced to slow down I use timelapse and slow motion footage to communicate the emotional impact of these two extremes.
