Lyn Taylor produced and directed this music video for Sydney musician Sara O'Connor. Lyn approached me to light the 
piece to achieve a high key look.

Shot at Lyn's studio in Petersham I was able to combine natural light through the large, scrimmed windows with warmer
artificial lighting on the musicians faces to separate them from the cooler background.
