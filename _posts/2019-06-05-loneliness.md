Brisbane-based Paddy McHugh came to Sydney late 2016 to record his second album "City Bound Trains". Lyn Taylor was on
site to record the session with still photographs for posterity. We took the opportunity to set up two Canon DSLRs to
capture live the recording of his track "Loneliness".

Responsibility then came to me to edit the footage and colour grade it. Being in the studio, recording the actual track for his album meant we could take the final mastered song and drop it in the timeline against these visuals. This is a great example of what can be achieved quickly with minimal equipment and time when you're already in the studio recording.
