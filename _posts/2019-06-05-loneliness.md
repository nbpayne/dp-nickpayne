Brisbane-based Paddy McHugh came to Sydney late 2016 to record his second album "City Bound Trains". Lyn Taylor was on
site to record the session with still photographs for posterity. She took the opportunity to set up two Canon DSLRs to
capture live the recording of his track "Loneliness".

Responsibility came to me to edit the footage and colour grade it. This is a great example of what can be achieved 
quickly with minimal equipment and time.
