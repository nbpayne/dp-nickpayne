The brief for Sarah O'Connor's music video "Sleepwalking" called for three sets with three distinct looks.

The stage set was achieved with fresnel back lighting and a fill light against a red velet theatre drape. Two smoke 
machines provided atmosphere to imply a smoke-filled jazz club. The dinner scene utilised a dimmed practical, a cooler
light backlighting the scene implying moonlight coming in through an open window and a narrow, warm keylight 
highligting Sara. The office scene used a large, soft, cool source to provide bright, even lighting through out the 
scene with warmer fill and a very cool source on the desk simulating the light from a computer screen.
