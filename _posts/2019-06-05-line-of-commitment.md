"Line of Commitment" is a short film currently in production by Concept Films. It explores the nature of commitment 
between a married couple when things start to go "stale".

Concept Films asked me to come on set for some interior shoots in order to light the scenes and raise the quality of
their content. I brought a bootful of gear to locations I'd not seen before and without a clear view from the director
on the treatment he was after. This meant I had to work on my feet to quickly come up with looks that suited the 
narrative using the gear that I had on hand.
