I had an amazing three days working as gaffer on Kieton Beilby's latest short --- A Little Strange --- which was written by Damian Overton and shot by Matt Gorrie. The film was made especially for the Smart Phone Film Festival 2024 (SF3) and was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro Max. It has been selected for screening at the Gala Final.

The film occurs in two locations. The first is a suburban front yard exterior, and the second an interior lounge room. The exteriors were lit with a combination of a 12' x 12' ultrabounce to bounce sunlight back into the films subjects and a Nanlux Evoke 1200 combined with Creamsource Vortex 8s. For the interiors we bounced light from the outside of the house through the windows to illuminate the lounge room. We did this by bouncing the Evoke 1200 and the Vortexes off 8' x 8' ultrabounces. The interior was further enhanced with Helios tubes on a boom for character backlights, Nanlite Pavobulbs in practical fixtures, and an Filex Q8 bounced off a polyboard to fill faces.

Many thanks to Tom Doyle of Moonlighting Film for the lighting package and Matt Gorrie for the opportunity to work with him again.
